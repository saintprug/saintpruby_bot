    full_description: "Hi there! If you've been waiting for a chance to:
      - work from anywhere in the world;
      - enjoy proper workflow while keeping focus on your tasks;
      - break out of the conveyor monotony;
      - leave bloody enterprise and endless rework of same things behind;
      - be heard by colleagues;
      - work with those who care

      Then welcome to Evrone!

      If you feel yourself more like extrovert, text @jezo4ka or search for the Evrone guys in bright T-shirts on the stand. You can first take part in the sphero-race and get some snacks and then confess that you are looking for a job if you are. And if you, like many guys in Evrone, are a bit introvert, then simply visit jobs.evrone.com/ru, we will contact you."
